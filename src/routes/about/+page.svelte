<h1>me</h1>

<p>
  I'm a frontend engineer, but I wasn't always. I'm currently based in Budapest, though home has
  been many places over the years, including Taipei, Vancouver, Montreal, and Dubai.

  If I'm not getting lost on walks or smelling lilacs in the garden, you can find me on
  <a href="https://github.com/kuosandys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Github</a>.
