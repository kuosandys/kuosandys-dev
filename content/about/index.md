Hey, I'm Sandy. Welcome to my little corner on the web.

I'm a frontend engineer but I wasn't always. I'm currently based in Budapest, though "home" has been many places over the years, including Taipei, Vancouver, Montreal, and Dubai.

I like rainy days, sci-fi/spec-fic books, and exploring the intersection of coding and creativity. I prefer RSS feeds over email newsletters.

I believe it's important to remember the human in every equation and I strive to craft more empathetic interfaces.

You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/kuosandys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a> or in the garden smelling the lilacs.
